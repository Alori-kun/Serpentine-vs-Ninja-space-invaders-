This game I created is the exact same mechanics as space invaders.
However, instead of space galaxy wars, it's one stranded Jay, stuck in time on the old Destiny Bounty, vs 6 Venomari.
I'm really sorry for the trash quality, and if lag happens. 
PLEASE DO NOT INTERFERE WITH ANY OF THE CODE!! This could completely the experience that you have, and may ruin the game.
Controls:
Arrow keys to move
Space to shoot lightning bolts
